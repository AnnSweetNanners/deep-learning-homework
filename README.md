CLOSING-
WIN 5 brought the projected numbers closer to the real numbers than any other model (less than $200 difference between the numbers), but the model isn't as good a fit as with WIN 10. 

FNG-
WIN 5 gave the best fit, with high number of epochs, but in all instances. the model looks worse than closing. Real and predicted prices with as much as $700 difference between them.
